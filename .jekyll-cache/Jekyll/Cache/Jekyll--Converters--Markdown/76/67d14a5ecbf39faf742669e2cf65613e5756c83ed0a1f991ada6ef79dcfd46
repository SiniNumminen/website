<p>ASSIST was a European research and action project on energy poverty research and alleviation. I managed the project activities in Finland in practice e.g. by organising energy-saving events (e.g. energy cafÃ©s) and producing reports. A highlight was a webinar in March 2020 where experts from academia, industry, civil society and state organisations shared views on energy poverty in Finland. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=CKwhm4RWCxo" target="_ blank">recording</a> (in Finnish) or read the <a href="https://www.vaasaett.com/s/Energypoverty_webinar_Finland20200325_report.pdf" target="_ blank">webinar report</a> (in English). We also published a <a href="https://www.assist2gether.eu/news-190-survey_heating_costs_a_significant_financial_burden_for_many_homeowners_in_finland" target="_ blank">report on interviews with vulnerable Finnish household owners</a>. ASSIST was probably the first EC funded project in Finland fully focusing on energy poverty.</p>

<p>ASSIST  (Support network for household energy saving) functioned in 6 European countries between 2017 and 2020. Key project results include <a href="https://www.vaasaett.com/s/vulnerable_consumers_and_fuel_poverty_report.pdf" target="_ blank">Vulnerable consumers and fuel poverty report</a> which is an overview of the profile of energy vulnerable people in Europe.

On 20 June 2019, Aalto University admitted me the degree of Doctor of Science in Technology. During the exciting four years, I studied off-grid and island solutions and PV (photovoltaic) technologies and their use among rural communities in India at the <a href="http://newenergy.physics.aalto.fi" target="_ blank">New Energy Technologies Research Group</a> in the School of Science at Aalto University, under the suprervision of <a href="https://people.aalto.fi/peter_lund" target="_ blank">Professor Peter D. Lund</a>. Special focus was the technical reliability and sustainability of solar photovoltaic micro-grids. Download the dissertation <i>Reliability and sustainability analyses of frugal solar photovoltaic micro-grid systems in emerging markets</i> from <a href="https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/37842" target="_ blank">Aaltodocs</a>. Research work consisted of<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>technical data analysis</strong> for measured data and laboratory tests for micro-grid system components;</li>
  <li><strong>interviews</strong> with off-grid energy practitioners (<a href="/industry_survey_2018/">industry survey conducted in 2018</a>), micro-grid field staff and solar energy users;</li>
  <li><strong>field trips</strong> and observative methods in poor off-grid communities in northern India</li>
  <li><strong>multi-disciplinary sustainability analyses, reliability engineering and development studies</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since 2017, I contributed in a <a href="http://sais-isep.org/?p=1984" target="_ blank">project</a> on technical questions of energy systems as a Student Fellow at SAIS-ISEP. The two year project is an ambitious and comprehensive program on technology adoption, power demand, and willingness to pay for mini-grid power in rural India for the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy (ISEP) at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).</p>

<p>In 2016, I participated in an <a href="http://egap.org/registration/1662" target="_
blank">extensive measurement experiment</a> of PV micro-grid supply and demand in Uttar Pradesh in India in collaboration with Columbia University and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1JHQZ2GsE" target="_ blank">Boond Ltd.</a>, an Indian energy access company and a social enterprise. In the experiment, <a href="http://sininumminen.fi/blog/Pico-grids/">solar pico-grids</a> were installed in seven habitations. In these habitations, the grid-connected households were randomly assigned different modes of electricity pricing on a weekly basis. The results were published in two papers <i>Power availability and reliability of solar pico-grids in rural areas: a case study from northern India</i> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221313881730632X" target="_ blank">(doi:10.1016/j.seta.2018.08.005)</a> and <i>An Evaluation of Dynamic Electricity Pricing for Solar Micro-Grids in Rural India</i> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X18300506" target="_ blank">(doi:10.1016/j.esr.2018.05.007)</a>.</p>
