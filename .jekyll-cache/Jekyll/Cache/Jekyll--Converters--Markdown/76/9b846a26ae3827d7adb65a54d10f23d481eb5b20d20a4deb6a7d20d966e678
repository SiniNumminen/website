<i>After the lectio, the opponent poses general and detailed questions on the dissertation topics and methods (up to 3.5 hours, we had about 2.5 hours). My opponent prof. W√§ckelg√•rd had put all of her questions on presentation slides which made the debate more pleasant also for the audience to follow! Here we discuss the differences in energy balance values in five solar micro-grid installation sites.</i></p>
