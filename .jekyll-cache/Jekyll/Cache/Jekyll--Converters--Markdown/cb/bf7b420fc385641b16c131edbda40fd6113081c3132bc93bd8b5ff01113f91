I"w<p>A persistent research interest of mine has been: How to save energy (how and why and where and by whom). Goes without saying, our energy and resources expenditure is on an unsustainable level and solutions and actions are needed rapidly. Few years ago, I studied energy consumption in extremely energy-poor communities in India, and one important conclusion of mine was that there is much to learn from the people who are living in scarcity, if we are to learn to save energy. The poor communities were very cautious with all types of consumption, but mainly because they had to. <a href="http://sininumminen.fi/Projects/">More about my doctoral project could be read here</a>. An important question remained bothering me: is it only poverty that makes people thrift, smart and careful? The extreme-poor might use the same amount of electrical energy within a week, than a wealthy Nordic inhabitant uses within a moment, just by living in an air-conditionend house. Is this a relevant comparison to make? Is there anything to do with the over-use of energy and materials among the rich and the wealthy? How to alleviate energy poverty?</p>
