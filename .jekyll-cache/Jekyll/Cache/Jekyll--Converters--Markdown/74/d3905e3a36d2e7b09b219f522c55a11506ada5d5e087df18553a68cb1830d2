<br />
On the 16th October, I got the opportunity to present the pico-grid research project results at the seminar <a href="https://www.siemenpuu.org/fi/event/promoting-solar-energy-and-solar-innovations-rural-areas" target="_blank">“PROMOTING SOLAR ENERGY AND SOLAR INNOVATIONS IN RURAL AREAS”</a> organised by the <a href="http://solarinnovations.org/Default.aspx" target="_blank">International Solar Innovations Council (InSIC)</a> together with Finnish development NGOs. The seminar was part of the series of InSIC events in Helsinki. See <a href="https://www.siemenpuu.org/fi/blog/insic-events-finland-highlight-wide-spectrum-ground-breaking-solar-innovations" target="_blank">seminar series report</a> written by Risto Isomäki. <a href="http://sininumminen.fi/assets/documents/Microgrids_reliability_SN.pdf">You may download my presentation from here.</a>

<b>Conclusions</b>
<br />
• Pico-scale energy reduced kerosene use and saved money spent on energy in low-income communities. Energy poverty reduction to a certain extent
<br />
<br />
• Pico-grids delivered more reliable power service (21 hours) than the DISCOM power system (16 hours). Overall good customer satisfaction
<br />
<br />
• Advice: Size the system according to energy needs. Sometimes PV-only is not sufficient for 365 days supply. However, hybrid systems may become too expensive
<br />
<br />
• Protective measures are important:
<br />
•• Store batteries in locked cases
<br />
•• Use theft-proof electronic components
<br />
•• Ensure proper customer education and satisfaction
<br />
•• Create a culture of respect towards the system</p>
