I"~<p>A popular movie scene is where the hero(/ine) arrives home, seemingly exhausted and worn from her world-saving activities; she takes off her clothes and steps into the shower cabin. Hot running water runs over her shoulders and daily anxieties clearly vanish away. In movies, taking long and hot showers visualizes protagonists’ need to relax. No wonder, because the scene is visually powerful and easy to realize. Just put the actor in the shower box, let the water flow, leave her there over the next scene and everybody knows what we are talking about.</p>

<p>But with which consequences! I believe that the symbolic role given for showering in cultural imageries, not only as a cleansing activity, but also a pleasing and relaxing activity impacts our collective showering practices – and keeps up our elevated (warm) water consumption. The showering questions goes not without significance because almost half (45%) of household’s water consumption relates to personal hygiene. This is the situation in Finland, at least [1]. Water heating requires energy, that typically still is extracted from fossil fuels. Us westerners take frequent showers and our shower times are long. In Finland, most people take six showers per week with the average duration of 4.3 minutes [1]. Finnish people surely have the connected energy-intensive practice which is sauna-heating, but let’s stick to showering for this time being.</p>

<p>Depending on your shower head, amount of water consumed varies. Remember the old-school shower heads of the 70’s? Water was flowing intensively, 15–18 liters per minute. Today, a standard shower head releases 12 litres/minute and water-thrift heads only 8–9 liters [2]. All the same, you’ll get clean using any of them. In energy and climate terms, cold shower would have zero CO2 emission. Warm showers of a four-person family requires 4000 kWh annually to heat up the water to 38 degrees [2]. This equals one ton of CO2 (4000 kWh X 250g_CO2ekv/kWh), if water is heated up with average electricity available in Finland [3].</p>

<p>Luckily the energy-thrift shower heads are gaining popularity, and bathing is less popular today than in, let’s say, 70’s. But I believe that many of us could easily close their showers several minutes earlier. Recently, intensivied hand-washing as a pandemic precaution increased warm water consumption, however, this energy practice is yet another one not to be compared with showering for habit or pleasure.</p>

<p>Kind of I understand the movie directors. Compared to other human ways of relaxing, say, spending time with friends, having massaged, sleeping, just sitting down, doing sports, you name it, would not send as straightforward visual movie-fit message, due to their many parallel meanings, requiring explanation and duration in film. Presenting other bad habits as ”cool” (such as smoking, sexist behaviour) in hero movies has gained attention and deserved critique. Showing how characters shower could also change. A true energy-hero might just say it aloud: ”Oh, what a hard day. I could take a one-hour water and energy consuming shower but I won’t. I just relax otherways”.</p>
