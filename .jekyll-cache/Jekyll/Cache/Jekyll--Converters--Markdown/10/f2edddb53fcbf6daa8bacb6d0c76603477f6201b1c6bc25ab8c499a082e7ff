I"«<p>My family is among the rare consumers (5-8%) still holding a market-based electricity tariff. I opted for it back in 2015 for climate and cost reasons, and we have ever since saved a fair  amount of money. Market-priced electricity continues to be cheap on an average night, similarly to  the popular time-of-use ‚Äúnight-electricity‚Äù tariffs. And with some attention, small shifts in consumption to cheaper hours lead to nice savings. December 2021 was an exception though: the price levels remained high or very high throughout the month, but the situation has evened itself out by now. On many of the recent weekends electricity has cost only about 2 cents/kWh, weekdays a bit more, which is usual.</p>
