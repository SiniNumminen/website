<h4><i> - The role of technical innovations for improved performance</i></h4>
<p><br />
There is a lively industry in India providing electricity access for millions of people living off-grid in India. These companies are innovative in finding new technical solutions and in utilizing them in resource-constrained settings and bringing affordability in service. At the same time, the technologies have to comply with a variety of quality requirements and changing user needs.</p>

<h2 id="meet-me-or-lets-setup-a-call">Meet me or letâ€™s setup a call</h2>

<p>As this is a very important and topical matter, I am looking for enthusiastic people to interview. If you are a practitioner, engineer, entrepreneur or other expert in this field, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me for an interview. I can arrange a Skype meeting or a telephone interview, or discuss via email, or you can meet me at the <a href="https://www.theclimategroup.org/event/india-energy-access-summit" target="_blank">India Energy Access Summit 2018</a> in Monday 12th - Tuesday 13th of February in New Delhi.</p>

<h2 id="survey-and-interviews">Survey and interviews</h2>

<p>This survey sheds light on the technical system innovations in the off-grid sector in India. These innovations may have played an essential role in bringing functionality, cost-effectiveness, reliability, efficiency or other benefits. Innovativeness may have been applied e.g. in component or system unit selection and design, control and distribution, demand-side, user interface, supply-side, metering, installations practices, materials selection etc.</p>

<p>Key technical interest lays on photovoltaic (PV) centered pico-grid, mini-grid and micro-grid systems.</p>

<p>This is mainly a technical study. The target is to understand the role that technology plays in providing sustainable energy services in remote off-grid areas in India in longer term. Other factors (economic, social, policy, environmental, practical) will be discussed, too, as they are inseparable part of the business environment.</p>

<p>The interviews are semi-structured and will be conducted either per Skype connection or in person. Thank you for your participation!</p>
