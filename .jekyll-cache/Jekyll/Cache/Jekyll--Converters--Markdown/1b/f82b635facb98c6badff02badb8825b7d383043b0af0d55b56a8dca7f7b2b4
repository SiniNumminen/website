I"5<p>A popular movie scene is where the hero(/ine) arrives home, seemingly exhausted and worn from her world-saving activities; she takes off her clothes and steps into the shower cabin. Hot running water runs over her shoulders and daily anxieties clearly vanish away. In movies, taking long and hot showers visualizes protagonistsâ€™ need to relax. No wonder, because the scene is visually powerful and easy to realize. Just put the actor in the shower box, let the water flow, leave her there over the next scene and everybody knows what we are talking about.</p>
