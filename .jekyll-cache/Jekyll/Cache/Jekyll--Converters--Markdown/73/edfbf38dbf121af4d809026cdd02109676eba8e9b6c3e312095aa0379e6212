<p>In my last blog [1] I called for more environmentally-friendly and weather-sensitive power consumption styles to private Finnish homes. For example, people should try to avoid using heavy loads (like electric vehicle chargers and saunas) in moments when renewable production is minimal, Finland is importing bunches of grey electricity from abroad, and when also everybody else is consuming and local fossil-fuelled power reserves are running and exhaling greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Now I propose an idea that popped in a Zoom conversation this spring with me and prof. Mikko Jalas when we pondered which is better: to penalize or incentivize people to being more green electricity users. Us, as also many other researchers, have concluded that one obstacle is that the general public is rather uninvolved in electricity markets for many reasons, such as lack of interest, lack of trust, but also due to market structures that are favouring the minority having capabilities and being interested in the energy market stuff. At that discussion, Energy Weather Forecast Campaign idea raised up.</p>

<p>Energy Weather Forecast simply means electricity production and consumption data illustrated, and represented interestingly to the general public. Similarly than TV weather forecasts currently do: show tomorrow’s rains and sunshine, energy forecast would also explain the expected wind, solar and hydro energy conditions of tomorrow and the week to come. Like this, all people could plan their electricity consumption to match the renewable production conditions, which would increase total green electricity consumption in the country. Launching of such an information campaign soon is timely. Wind energy plants are finally being increasingly constructed Finland: last year wind power production increased 30% [2]. We should ensure it is 100% utilized. Curtailment, meaning, turning wind turbines down when windy, is not good.</p>

<p>A weather announcement could sound like this: “A lot of wind power production expected in the Ostrobothnia, tomorrow it is a good time to wash laundry and bake”. Or “Water reserves low in Norway – try avoiding electrical activities for the next 2 days when it have rained sufficiently again in the mountains.” With these words, cryptic energy system and wholesale market data is explained in practical terms. Similarly that cryptic atmospheric data is currently explained in weather forecasts. Project could be planned and conducted as a collaborative project with a TV channel, a metrological weather institute and energy system and market analysts. Not forgetting designers and storytellers to take care of understandability of the messages. Ministries having green energy targets could demonstrate political support. Market actors could be involved, but very carefully selected (to avoid giving false impression that this is a sales project). It should be an information campaign project, hopefully remaining as something permanent. At least four benefits arise.</p>

<p>Benefit 1)
Making a new collective sport: rhythmicizing domestic chores along with renewable power for world-saving</p>

<p>People’s daily and weekly schedules and routines have becomed less fixed through more distance working during COVID-19 lockdowns. The situation is expected to remain also after pandemia. For example, a large Finnish energy retailer reported right after the first COVID lockdown one year ago, how domestic power consumption curves immediately got more flat [4]. In other words: as people were free from fixed commuting hours, cooking and washing no longer concentrated to hours between 5 PM and 9 PM. Cooking and washing went all day round. The same must apply to many other types of consumption, too.</p>

<p>Adding some carnival spirit, institution and with high visibility ensures tangible and longer-term benefits. The project should not end up as yet another data mining exercise and buried to the graveyear of outdated websites. No, please. Integrating Energy Weather Forecast to some existing weather TV forecast broadcast would be recommended. A fixed broadcasting time and a popular weather forecaster? Who could accept the challenge?</p>

<p>Little by little, new behaviour patterns, adjusted according to renewable energy availability, becomes more routinized. First, the early adopters (green forerunners promoting their consumption shifts in social media?), and slowly the wider public. Eventually we might all target to wash laundry in windy days, similarly than we target remembering to take umbrellas in rainy days.</p>

<p>Benefit 2)
Bringing a realistic and honest representation of green electricity for the general public and thereby increasing general awareness</p>

<p>The fact that the greenness of electricity is dynamic and fluctuates hourly and daily, is rarely brought up in energy discussions and discourses. It appears as a secret, known only by the privileged minority of experts (why?). Retailers, for example, might sell you a 100% green power contract, which indeed might incentivize companies to construct more renewable plants. But in reality, no user of an inter-connected electricity system is 100% green 24/7. Prime-time consumption, in most cases, is non-green. Publicly available and visually interesting websites representing energy system and market conditions are nearly non-existing. The best site is developed by a private individual (see www.sahko.tk [5]) and not any energy company or authority. That website, too, includes only economic information. The dynamic greennes index of production and consumption is absent from nearly all energy system presentations. (First, such a greenness index might need to be invented, but it might not be too hard at least to give an estimate).</p>

<p>Benefit 3)
Increased energy awareness brings innovation opportunities for companies</p>

<p>Just imagine the innovation potential for energy companies and retailers after such a visible energy-education campaign! A greater and heterogeneous group of energy-aware citizen participating in making the power system green! This group would also include people not sharing interest in tedious mobile apps, control platforms and electronics, SPOT contracts and other obscure technical energy market stuff that are mainly designed for technically-oriented men in technical professions. There is much innovation going on for automated load control, but in reality, not everybody agrees to renounce the control over (any) their devices for a remote intelligence, it’s as simple as that.</p>

<p>Benefit 4)
Making consumption shifts popular and fashionable before protesters (à la Sweden) take over</p>

<p>Energy Weather Forecast is a nice idea because it is NOT political. It relies on scientific and technical facts: the changing weather and changing energy system status. People will continue to be masters of their personal consumption. This is important. Because energy political talk nearly always gets over-heated and misunderstood especially when it comes to comparing pros and cons of different energy forms. From this grounds, various enlightenment campaigns educating the public for smarter/greener/thriftier energy behaviours could lead to unexpected consequences, if the timing or the tone of voice is wrong. Something like that happened in Sweden in February 2021.</p>

<p>A Swedish news channel SVT made a short educative video [6] about the climate-friendly electricity use. They educated the public on the dynamics of energy systems’ greenness. As a practical example the journalist suggested people to hoover only at system-favourable hours. Critics – probably having joined forces with critics of a recent decision to shut down a nuclear plant – organised themselves into a political movement called Dammsugarupproret (Vacuum cleaning rebelliong) and to show-off, demonstrated many non-energy-smart collective actions. Eventually energy minister was called to calm the public to say that everybody is free to vacuum whenever they like [7].</p>

<p>The political weather was right to pick the project (with a good purpose) to support other political purposes. Result was almost completely something else than foreseen by the video-makers.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Energy Weather Forecast. Who could accept the challenge?</p>
