I":<p>A popular movie scene is where the heroine gets home, visibly exhausted and worn out from her world-saving activities; she takes her clothes off and steps into the shower. Hot running water pours over her shoulders washing away the daily anxieties. In movies, taking long, hot showers demonstrates the lead actressesâ€™ need to relax. No wonder, because the scene is visually powerful and easy to carry out. Just put the actress in the shower, let the water flow, leave her there over the scene and everybody knows what we are talking about. Everyone can relate.</p>
