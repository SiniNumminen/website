## Working title: Here share information from my research trips in India

(It is also possible to change the above title "Research" to another one by changing markdowns. See instrctions on: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet ) <br> <br>
I am a PhD student and an electrical engineer from Finland. I study off-grid solar micro-grids and energy access in India, with the special focus on the technical reliability and sustainability. In 2016, I participated in an extensive measurement experiment of PV micro-grid supply and demand in Uttar Pradesh in India in collaboration with Columbia University and Boond Ltd, an Indian social entrepreneur. On this website, I share information from my research trips in India. The views and opinions are of my own.
