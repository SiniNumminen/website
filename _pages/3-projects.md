## Power demand and technology adoption study in rural India 2017 - 2019

Since 2017, I have advised in a [project](http://sais-isep.org/?p=1984){:target="_blank"} on technical questions of energy systems as a Student Fellow at SAIS-ISEP. The two year project is an ambitious and comprehensive program on technology adoption, power demand, and willingness to pay for mini-grid power in rural India for the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy (ISEP) at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).

## A Frugal Innovation Approach to Dynamic Electricity Pricing in Rural India: A Field Experiment 2016 - 2017

In 2016, I participated in an [extensive measurement experiment](http://egap.org/registration/1662){:target="_blank"} of PV micro-grid supply and demand in Uttar Pradesh in India in collaboration with Columbia University and [Boond Ltd.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1JHQZ2GsE){:target="_blank"}, an Indian energy access company and a social enterprise. In the experiment, [solar pico-grids](http://sininumminen.fi/blog/Pico-grids/) were installed in seven habitations. In these habitations, the grid-connected households were randomly assigned different modes of electricity pricing on a weekly basis. The results will be published in 2018.

## New Global of Aalto University

I am a member of an [interdisciplinary innovation and action research network New Global](http://newglobal.aalto.fi){:target="_blank"}. Through action research, experimentation, co-creation this network aims to foster the necessary capabilities for co-creating frugal and reverse innovations in global systems.

## PhD research project: The importance of frugal energy innovations in global energy transitions

Since 2015, I have studied off-grid and island solutions and PV (photovoltaic) technologies and India. Special focus was chosen as the technical reliability and sustainability questions of energy technologies that are manufactured low-cost. Research work is versatile. By far, I have conducted<br>

  * **laboratory tests** for energy system components;
  * **technical data analysis** and mathematical simulations;
  * **interviews** for practitioners and energy users and
  * **extensive literature searches** in the fields of innovation studies, development studies and solar energy engineering.
