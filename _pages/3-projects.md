## PhD research project: The importance of frugal energy innovations in global energy transitions 2015 – 2019

Since 2015, I have studied off-grid and island solutions and PV (photovoltaic) technologies and India. Special focus was chosen as the technical reliability and sustainability questions of solar photovoltaic micro-grids. Research work consisted of<br>

  * **technical data analysis** for measured data;
  * **interviews** with off-grid energy practitioners and solar energy users:
  * **laboratory tests** for energy system components and
  * **literature searches** in sustainability analysis, reliability engineering, development studies and solar energy engineering.

## Power demand and technology adoption study in rural India 2017 – 2019

Since 2017, I contributed in a [project](http://sais-isep.org/?p=1984){:target="_ blank"} on technical questions of energy systems as a Student Fellow at SAIS-ISEP. The two year project is an ambitious and comprehensive program on technology adoption, power demand, and willingness to pay for mini-grid power in rural India for the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy (ISEP) at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).

## A Frugal Innovation Approach to Dynamic Electricity Pricing in Rural India: A Field Experiment 2016 – 2017

In 2016, I participated in an [extensive measurement experiment](http://egap.org/registration/1662){:target="_
blank"} of PV micro-grid supply and demand in Uttar Pradesh in India in collaboration with Columbia University and [Boond Ltd.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1JHQZ2GsE){:target="_ blank"}, an Indian energy access company and a social enterprise. In the experiment, [solar pico-grids](http://sininumminen.fi/blog/Pico-grids/) were installed in seven habitations. In these habitations, the grid-connected households were randomly assigned different modes of electricity pricing on a weekly basis. The results were published in two papers <i>Power availability and reliability of solar pico-grids in rural areas: a case study from northern India</i> [(doi:10.1016/j.seta.2018.08.005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221313881730632X){:target="_ blank"} and <i>An Evaluation of Dynamic Electricity Pricing for Solar Micro-Grids in Rural India</i> [(doi:10.1016/j.esr.2018.05.007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X18300506){:target="_ blank"}.

## New Global of Aalto University 2015 – 2016

  I am a member of an [interdisciplinary innovation and action research network New Global](http://newglobal.aalto.fi){:target="_ blank"}. Through action research, experimentation, co-creation this network aims to foster the necessary capabilities for co-creating frugal and reverse innovations in global systems. New Global project funded my PhD research project during 2015 and 2016.
