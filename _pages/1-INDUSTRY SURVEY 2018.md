## Indian solar PV off-grid sector for a sustainable energy transition
<h3> Role of technical innovations for improved performance</h3>

There is a lively industry in India providing electricity access for the hundreds of millions of people living off-grid in India. These companies are innovative in finding new technical solutions and in utilizing them in resource-constrained settings. The match with affordability in service and innovative technical design is often called "frugal innovation". At the same time, the technologies have to comply with a variety of technical quality requirements and the changing user needs.

## Meet me or let's setup a call

As this is a very important and topical matter, I am looking for enthusiastic people to interview. If you find yourself being an expert in this field, please don't hesitate to contact me for an interview.

<br>
I can arrange a Skype meeting or telephone interview, or disuss via email, or you can meet me at the Indian Energy Access Summit in Monday 12th - Tuesday 13th of February in New Delhi. There is also a possibility to meet me during the couple of days after the event.

## Survey and interviews

This survey sheds light on the technical system innovations in the off-grid sector in India. These innovations may have played an essential role in bringing functionality, cost-effectiveness, reliability, efficiency or other benefits. Innovativeness may have been applied e.g. in component or system unit selection and desig, control and distribution, demand-side, user interface, supply-side, metering, installations practises, materials selection etc.

Key technical interest lays on photovoltaic (PV) centered pico-grid, mini-grid and micro-grid systems.

This is mainly a technical study. The target is to understand the role that technology plays in providing sustainable energy services in remote off-grid areas in India in longer term. Other factors (economic, social, policy, environmental, practical) will be discussed, too, as they are unseparable part of the business environment.

The interviews are semi-structured and will be conducted either per Skype connection or in person. Thank you for your participation!
