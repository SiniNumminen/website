### Sini Numminen, M.Sc.(Tech.)

<br>

I am a PhD student at the School of Science at Aalto University, Finland. In 2009 I graduated from Helsinki University of Technology in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Development Studies at the Department of Social Sciences in Helsinki University. After graduation I worked in Germany as a researcher in a European association Distributed Energy Resources Laboratories (DERlab) where I gained a strong insight on the potential of renewable and distributed power units and the smart grids concept. My PhD work is supported by a research grant from the Tiina and Antti Herlin Foundation, Finland.

* [Implications of frugal innovations on sustainable development: evaluating water and energy innovations](http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/1/4){:target="_blank"} - Levänen, J., Hossain, M., Lyytinen, T., Hyvärinen, A., Numminen, S., Halme, M. (2016). Sustainability 2016, 8(1), 4; doi:10.3390/su8010004. Abstract: Frugal innovations are often associated with sustainable development. These connections, however, are based on anecdotal assumptions rather than empirical evidence. This article evaluates sustainability of four frugal innovations from water and energy sectors. For the purposes of the evaluation a set of indicators was developed. Indicators are drawn from sustainable development goals by the United Nations and they encompass central dimensions of sustainability: ecological, social and economic. Frugal innovations were compared to solutions that are currently used in similar low-income contexts. Studied frugal innovations were found more sustainable in terms of energy production and water purification capacity than the existing solutions. In terms of social sustainability larger differences between innovations were found. For example, business models of frugal energy solutions focus on capacity building and the inclusion of marginalized low-income people, whereas business models of water purification solutions focus on more traditional corporate social responsibility activities such as marketing awareness campaigns and cooperation with non-governmental organizations. Three major sustainability challenges for frugal innovators were identified: 1) the proper integration of material efficiency into product or service systems, 2) the patient promotion of inclusive employment, and 3) the promotion of inclusive and sustainable local industrialization. Article concludes that despite indisputable similarities between frugality and sustainability, it is problematic to equate the two conceptually.

* [Frugal energy innovations for developing countries – a framework](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.1012/full){:target="_blank"} - Numminen, S., Lund, P.D. (2016). Global Challenges. John Wiley & Sons. doi:10.1002/gch2.1012. Abstract: Frugal innovations have recently emerged to feature low-cost technologies and business innovations to serve consumers in emerging markets and improve their quality of life. Although the concept of frugality is well known, the present literature on frugal energy innovations, or energy frugality, is scarce, which could lead to overlooking its true characteristics. Therefore, we propose a framework for defining energy frugality based on a detailed analysis of several low-cost sustainable energy technologies. The five-criteria assessmentmethod developed will help to identify potential frugal energy innovations and will increase the adoption of these technologies through better matching to local needs. Fuel-efficient biomass cooking stoves, small-scale photovoltaic systems, and pico-grids are examples of such frugal energy technologies.
