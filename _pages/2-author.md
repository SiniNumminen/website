### Sini Numminen, M.Sc.(Tech.)

{% imager research_team.jpg|right|50%|alt="test" %}
I am a PhD student at the School of Science at Aalto University, Finland. In 2009 I graduated from Helsinki University of Technology in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Development Studies at the Department of Social Sciences in Helsinki University. After graduation I worked in Germany as a researcher in a European association Distributed Energy Resources Laboratories (DERlab) where I gained a strong insight on the potential of renewable and distributed power units and the smart grids concept. My PhD work is supported by a research grant from the Tiina and Antti Herlin Foundation, Finland.

## Publications

* [Implications of frugal innovations on sustainable development: evaluating water and energy innovations](http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/1/4){:target="_blank"} - Levänen, J., Hossain, M., Lyytinen, T., Hyvärinen, A., Numminen, S., Halme, M. (2016). Sustainability 2016, 8(1), 4; doi:10.3390/su8010004. Abstract (extract): Frugal innovations are often associated with sustainable development. These connections, however, are based on anecdotal assumptions rather than empirical evidence. This article evaluates sustainability of four frugal innovations from water and energy sectors. For the purposes of the evaluation a set of indicators was developed. Indicators are drawn from sustainable development goals by the United Nations and they encompass central dimensions of sustainability: ecological, social and economic. - - -

* [Frugal energy innovations for developing countries – a framework](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.1012/full){:target="_blank"} - Numminen, S., Lund, P.D. (2016). Global Challenges. John Wiley & Sons. doi:10.1002/gch2.1012. Abstract (extract): Frugal innovations have recently emerged to feature low-cost technologies and business innovations to serve consumers in emerging markets and improve their quality of life. Although the concept of frugality is well known, the present literature on frugal energy innovations, or energy frugality, is scarce, which could lead to overlooking its true characteristics. Therefore, we propose a framework for defining energy frugality based on a detailed analysis of several low-cost sustainable energy technologies. - - -
