## Indian solar PV off-grid sector for a sustainable energy transition
<h3> The role of technical innovations for improved performance</h3>


Problem: There is a rather lively off-grid industry of small entrepreneurs in India that provide electricity access for the hundreds of millions of off-grid people in India. However, the majority of their customers are low-income with unsteady incomes. Therefore, also the technical system design and manufacturing costs have to be set as low as possible. There is some evidence that not all off-grid technologies are durable and have long lifetimes. Further, some have stated that off-grid technologies will remain solely temporary solutions because the Indian government currently pushes the 100% electrification target with the means of grid expansion. The target of the study is to find out the long-term technical capabilities of off-grid PV systems in India â€“ touching technical and practical questions, as well as economic and societal side.

Research question: Target of this research project is to evaluate the relevance of off-grid energy systems in rural India in providing sustainable energy services.
