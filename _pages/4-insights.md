Access to affordable technical solutions is a key in relieving energy poverty among the poorest customer groups in developing countries. My research topic is off-grid and island solutions and PV (photovoltaic) technologies and India. Special focus is on the technical reliability and sustainability and quality questions of energy technologies and their role in providing energy services in a long-term. The views and opinions on this website are of my own.
