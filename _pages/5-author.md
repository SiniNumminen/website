### Sini Numminen, M.Sc.(Tech.)

<br>

Affordable technical solutions are a key in relieving energy poverty among the poorest customer groups in developing countries. I am a PhD student at the School of Science at Aalto University, Finland. My topic is off-grid and island solutions and PV (photovoltaic) technologies and India. Special focus is on the technical reliability and sustainability and quality questions of energy technologies that are manufactured low-cost. 

In 2009 I graduated from Helsinki University of Technology in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Development Studies at the Department of Social Sciences in Helsinki University. After graduation I worked in Germany as a researcher in a European association Distributed Energy Resources Laboratories (DERlab) where I gained a strong insight on the potential of renewable and distributed power units and the smart grids concept.

My PhD work is supported by a research grant from the Tiina and Antti Herlin Foundation, Finland.

## Projects

* [Student Fellow at SAIS-ISEP](http://sais-isep.org/?p=1984){:target="_blank"} - Since 2017,
I have advised in a project on technical questions of energy systems. The two year project is an ambitious and comprehensive program on technology adoption, power demand, and willingness to pay for mini-grid power in rural India for the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy (SAIS) at the 
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).

* [A Frugal Innovation Approach to Dynamic Electricity Pricing in Rural India: A Field Experiment](http://egap.org/registration/1662){:target="_blank"} - In 2016, I participated in an extensive measurement experiment of PV micro-grid supply and demand in Uttar Pradesh in India in collaboration with Columbia University and Boond Ltd, an Indian social entrepreneur. In the experiment, households in seven habitations are randomly assigned different modes of electricity pricing on a weekly basis.  Results will be published in 2018.

* [New Global of Aalto University](http://newglobal.aalto.fi){:target="_blank"} - I am a member of interdisciplinary innovation and action research network New Global. Through action research, experimentation, co-creation this network aims to foster the necessary capabilities for co-creating frugal and reverse innovations in global systems.
