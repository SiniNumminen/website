## Doctoral research project: The importance of frugal energy innovations in global energy transitions 2015 – 2019

{% imager research_team.jpg|right|50%|alt="test" %}
On 20 June 2019, Aalto University admitted me the degree of Doctor of Science in Technology. During the exciting four years, I studied off-grid and island solutions and PV (photovoltaic) technologies and their use among rural communities in India at the [New Energy Technologies Research Group](http://newenergy.physics.aalto.fi){:target="_ blank"} in the School of Science at Aalto University, under the suprervision of [Professor Peter D. Lund](https://people.aalto.fi/peter_lund){:target="_ blank"}. Special focus was the technical reliability and sustainability of solar photovoltaic micro-grids. Download the dissertation <i>Reliability and sustainability analyses of frugal solar photovoltaic micro-grid systems in emerging markets</i> from [Aaltodocs](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/37842){:target="_ blank"}. Research work consisted of<br>

  * **technical data analysis** for measured data and laboratory tests for micro-grid system components;
  * **interviews** with off-grid energy practitioners ([industry survey conducted in 2018](/industry_survey_2018/)), micro-grid field staff and solar energy users;
  * **field trips** and observative methods in poor off-grid communities in northern India
  * **multi-disciplinary sustainability analyses, reliability engineering and development studies**.

## Power demand and technology adoption study in rural India 2017 – 2019

Since 2017, I contributed in a [project](http://sais-isep.org/?p=1984){:target="_ blank"} on technical questions of energy systems as a Student Fellow at SAIS-ISEP. The two year project is an ambitious and comprehensive program on technology adoption, power demand, and willingness to pay for mini-grid power in rural India for the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy (ISEP) at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).

## A Frugal Innovation Approach to Dynamic Electricity Pricing in Rural India: A Field Experiment 2016 – 2017

In 2016, I participated in an [extensive measurement experiment](http://egap.org/registration/1662){:target="_
blank"} of PV micro-grid supply and demand in Uttar Pradesh in India in collaboration with Columbia University and [Boond Ltd.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1JHQZ2GsE){:target="_ blank"}, an Indian energy access company and a social enterprise. In the experiment, [solar pico-grids](http://sininumminen.fi/blog/Pico-grids/) were installed in seven habitations. In these habitations, the grid-connected households were randomly assigned different modes of electricity pricing on a weekly basis. The results were published in two papers <i>Power availability and reliability of solar pico-grids in rural areas: a case study from northern India</i> [(doi:10.1016/j.seta.2018.08.005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221313881730632X){:target="_ blank"} and <i>An Evaluation of Dynamic Electricity Pricing for Solar Micro-Grids in Rural India</i> [(doi:10.1016/j.esr.2018.05.007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X18300506){:target="_ blank"}.

## New Global of Aalto University 2015 – 2016

I am a member of an [interdisciplinary innovation and action research network New Global](http://newglobal.aalto.fi){:target="_ blank"}. Through action research, experimentation, co-creation this network aims to foster the necessary capabilities for co-creating frugal and reverse innovations in global systems.
