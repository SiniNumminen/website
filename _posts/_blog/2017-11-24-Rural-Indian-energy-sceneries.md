Uttar Pradesh is one of the most energy poor states in India, where the majority of people do not have acces to electricity. Here are some images of the things I witnessed during my research trips to the rural areas.

The power running through the high-voltage transmission lines in the background is non-accessible for the villagers. Water irrigation pump in the foreground is diesel-powered.

The national disribution company (DISCOM) pole in the nearby city Unnao. The distribution system is highly unreliable and offers electricity for 8-12 hours per day. Problems are due to technical and political reasons. The outages are unscheduled. A number of connecting cables in this pole are illegal and belong to nearby entrepreneurs and households.

<br>
{% imager scenery_two_distribution_poles.jpg|center %}
The state-owned distribution pole (made of concrete, on the left) is useless, as the wires do not feed electricity. The pole on the right is for the village solar micro-grid installed by the local energy entrepreneur. 

<br>
{% imager scenery_microgrid_panel.jpg|center %}
Solar suits well for rural off-grid areas especially due to abundant amounts of sunshine, compared to large Indian cities where pollution reduces solar output.

Kerosene lamps are still widely used for lighting in Indian countryside homes. They produce dangerous exhaust fumes.

Dried buffalo dung cakes are used as fuel in kitchen stoves, for making food.
