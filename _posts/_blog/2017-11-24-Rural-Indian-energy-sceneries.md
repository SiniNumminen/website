Uttar Pradesh is one of the most energy poor states in India, where the majority of people do not have access to electricity. Here are some images of the things I witnessed during my research trips to the rural areas.

The power running through the high-voltage transmission lines in the background is non-accessible for the villagers. Water irrigation pump in the foreground is diesel-powered.

The national disribution company (DISCOM) pole in the nearby city Unnao. The distribution system is highly unreliable and offers electricity for 8-12 hours per day. Problems are due to technical and political reasons. The outages are unscheduled. A number of connecting cables in this pole are illegal and belong to nearby entrepreneurs and households.

The state-owned distribution pole (made of concrete, on the left) is useless, as the wires do not feed electricity. The pole on the right is for the village solar micro-grid installed by the local energy entrepreneur.

Solar suits well for rural off-grid areas especially due to abundant amounts of sunshine, compared to large Indian cities where pollution reduces solar output.
