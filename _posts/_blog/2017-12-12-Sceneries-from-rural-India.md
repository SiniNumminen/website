Uttar Pradesh is one of the most energy poor states in India, where the majority of people do not have access to electricity. Here are some images of the things I witnessed during my research trips to the rural areas. Energy poverty is overwhelming which leads people to pendle between a variety of energy sources. Living under the grid shows 

These pictures are from the northern Indian state Uttar Pradesh, near the city of Unnao.

The national disribution company (DISCOM) pole in the nearby city Unnao. The distribution system is highly unreliable and offers electricity for 8-12 hours per day. Problems are due to technical and political reasons. The outages are unscheduled. A number of connecting cables in this pole are illegal and belong to nearby entrepreneurs and households.

The state-owned distribution pole (made of concrete, on the left) is useless, as the wires do not feed electricity. The pole on the right is for the village solar micro-grid installed by the local energy entrepreneur.

Solar suits well for rural off-grid areas especially due to abundant amounts of sunshine, compared to large Indian cities where pollution reduces solar output.

Kerosene lamps are still widely used for lighting in Indian countryside homes. Kerosene is subsidied by the state and well available around the country. They produce dangerous exhaust fumes.
