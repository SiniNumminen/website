 My general research interested has been long time the possibility for energy consumption reduction in different societies on earth. My doctoral research project was about extremely energy-poor communities' energy (non-) consumption in India, and my general conclusion is that there is a lot to learn from those people, in their energy efficiency and energy smart behaviour. As my primary question remained: is it only the poverty that makes people to be thrift and smart and careful? While the energy difference is so enormous (the extreme-poor might use the same amount of electrical energy within a week, than a wealthy Nordic inhabitant uses, without noticing, just by living in an air-conditionend house). Is there anything  to do with the over-use of energy and materials among the rich and the wealthy? Is this the question to pose?

On one hand my scientific interests are connected with the ideas of non-use, reduction, recycling, saving, frugality, degrowth (in the material and consumerist sense), and the underlying ideas. I would like to explore whether it is the mindset, technologies, policies, behaviours, economics, some external force, or something else, or their dependencies and interferences, that could make us even a bit smarter (or not-over-using) with energy and resources. In addition to these societal and psychological speculations (where I will come back later), I am also interested in the importance of knowledge, education and right information in this context. In my opinion there is a disconnection in people's understanding of "energy" and their energy-intensive lives. Energy systems are complex, and it is no wonder that people get mixed up when it comes to the goodness of some energy source, or some technology.

People do understand that they consume a lot of resources, but what is the extent to which their behaviour will be or could be changed? I have been holding energy and energy efficiency lectures for secondary school pupils and I have found that bringing the questions of scale to their eyes have been enlighting. How much energy? And especially, used for what purpose? Energy for cooking? That is important. Energy for heating? That is important. Energy for cold storage? That is important, but could be compromised alreayd in some or many occasions. (later I will probably need to write few lines about my experiences in those school visits and some insights about how to develop the physics classes, and to bring some bright ideas of the school pupils here, too).

On another hand, I have my technological interests (comes through I am  an engineer, perhaps). There is a plethora of different types of technical equipment or solutions that target to consumption control (or are promoted as such), in a way or another: either in time (e.g. hourly pricing) or in amount (e.g. fuses), with the large purpose of smart use or demand-side-management. I must confess that I am by default sceptical to all new ideas to try to master a standard consumer. There are good ideas, and I am very keen on finding those and studying why they have succeeded (e.g. reducing energy consumption in a household not only the standard 2%, but some significant amount such as 10%). Or was it the technology, eventually? But the communication and a collective educative project surrounding the whole DSM box, that eventually could be appraised of some gains?

In this blog series I want, on the other hand, reflect some side streams of my actual research, present insight that do not belong in the scientific publications and, on the other hand, show some un-used ideas and thoughts for further elaboration by also others. Opinions presented are purely my own.

With this introduction I would like to welcome you to also to send me feedback (per email or through Twitter preferably), if you liked some writing, or have a critique or note to make. Thank you and enjoy!
