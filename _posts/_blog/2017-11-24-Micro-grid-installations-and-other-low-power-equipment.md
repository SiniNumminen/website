Local entrepreneur has setup micro-grids in seven villages in Uttar Pradesh, India. Locals are innovative in their energy use.

This smart meter has just one design fault: Reptiles can enter the casing from the bottom of the meter. An unfortunate lizard made a home in one of the meters and it  exploded.

Typically this is how the setup of a microgrid was demonstrated in the household; including direct current socket, switches for turning on and off the lighting and a smart energy meter.

Smoke from indoor cooking stoves and kerosene lamps have stained the electrical installations in this home.

Shading and unoptimal mounting angles of photovoltaic (PV) panels reduce their power output. The panels on the left are professionally installed by the local micro-grid entrepreneur, at the optimal 23 degrees.

”DC (direct current) is common knowledge”, I learned. This boy shows me how he had repaired a broken socket in his home.

{% imager DC_solar_gadgets_PV.jpg|center %}
A variety of solar panels pop up on rooftops. These private panels have a nominal capacity of 15 W and they are used for charging mobile phones directly without a controller. Lack of a charge controller feeds an unregulated current to devices which damages them.

This is an old motocycle battery which was configured by locals to power up an extra light bulb in the corridor of their house.
