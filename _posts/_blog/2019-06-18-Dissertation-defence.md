  Dissertation defence is a unique experience for every doctoral student. At Aalto University School of Science, at least, the procedure includes a lecture (Lectio) of 20 minutes by the student and after this a nominated opponent (somebody with a doctor's degree) poses up to 3.5 hours (typically 2 hours) of questions.

<i>Frugal thinking is typical in low-income settings, demonstrated by many smart innovations. In this picture a protection innovation for solar micro-grids: a row of nails prohibiting birds from landing on top.</i>

<i>After the lectio, the opponent poses general and detailed questions on the dissertation topics and methods (up to 3.5 hours, we had about 2.5 hours). My opponent prof. Wäckelgård had put all of her questions on presentation slides which made the debate more pleasant also for the audience to follow! Here we discuss the differences in energy balance values in five solar micro-grid installation sites.</i>

<i>Officially the university decides upon the acceptance of the dissertation – but they were aligned with the recommendation of the opponent. :) The dean of the School of Science of Aalto University granted me the degree of a D.Sc. (Tech.) on 20 June, 2019.</i>
