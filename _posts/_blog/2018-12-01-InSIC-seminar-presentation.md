On the 16th October, I got the opportunity to present the pico-grid research project results at the seminar ["PROMOTING SOLAR ENERGY AND SOLAR INNOVATIONS IN RURAL AREAS"](https://www.siemenpuu.org/fi/event/promoting-solar-energy-and-solar-innovations-rural-areas){:target="_blank"} organised by the [International Solar Innovations Council (InSIC)](http://solarinnovations.org/Default.aspx){:target="_blank"} together with Finnish development NGOs. The seminar was part of the series of InSIC events in Helsinki. See [seminar series report](https://www.siemenpuu.org/fi/blog/insic-events-finland-highlight-wide-spectrum-ground-breaking-solar-innovations){:target="_blank"} written by Risto Isomäki.

<b>Conclusions</b>
<br>
• Pico-scale energy reduced kerosene use and saved money spent on energy in low-income communities. Energy poverty reduction to a certain extent
<br>
<br>
• Pico-grids delivered more reliable power service (21 hours) than the DISCOM power system (16 hours). Overall good customer satisfaction
<br>
<br>
• Advice: Size the system according to energy needs. Sometimes PV-only is not sufficient for 365 days supply. However, hybrid systems may become too expensive
<br>
<br>
• Protective measures are important:
<br>
•• Store batteries in locked cases
<br>
•• Use theft-proof electronic components
<br>
•• Ensure proper customer education and satisfaction
<br>
•• Create a culture of respect towards the system
