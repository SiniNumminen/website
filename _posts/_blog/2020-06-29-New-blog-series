excerpted: |
 I have been long time interested and bothered by the possibilities of energy consumption reduction which would be very very important but quite
 impossible (with the necessary extent) and therefore rather unlikely (taking into account the fact that there global energy consumption still
 continues to increase etc). I feel there is a general disconnection in people's understanding of "energy" and their energy-intensive lives. ---

 I have been long time interested and bothered by the possibilities of energy consumption reduction which would be very very important but quite
 impossible (with the necessary extent) and therefore rather unlikely (taking into account the fact that there global energy consumption still
 continues to increase etc). I feel there is a general disconnection in people's understanding of "energy" and their energy-intensive lives.

 In this blog series I want, on the other hand, reflect some side streams of my actual research, present insight that do not belong in the scientific
 publications, on the other hand, some background ideas and underlying thoughts ---

 In august 2020 I will start as a postdoc at the Department of design at Aalto university with demand side flexibility topics, energy efficiency
 and energy justice ---
