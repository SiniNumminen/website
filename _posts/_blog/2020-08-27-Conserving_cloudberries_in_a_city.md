This summer I picked a lot of cloudberries. I found them in North Karelia of Finland (Pohjois-Karjala). This was an exceptional year. They told me it was last time some year in the 1990’s when there were so many cloudberries. Cloudberries are rare, special and expensive. And their picking is hard work: you must deal with swarms of mosquitoes and other bugs and cross hard-to-get wetlands. Just a couple of days ago, the price in a supermarket in Helsinki was 20€/kg which was a relatively good offer, in comparison with other years. However, I was not selling my harvest. To be able to enjoy their sweet and vitamin-rich taste over the upcoming winter, I want the best storage conditions for my precious cloudberries.

Freezing berries in small boxes is a good option. Like that, the berries conserve their original shape and taste. This summer 2020 was also an exceptional blueberry year. So my kitchen fridge-freezer could not bear it all. Therefore, I had to plug in a second, smaller fridge (of around 80 litres, ~150 kWh/year). Assuming I will need it running and cold for the next 6 months, I will need an extra 75 kWh of electrical energy for the storage. Is this a high amount or not? In comparison with the power draw of many other devices, an average 17 Watts is not very much (=150kWh/a/8736h/a). A Wi-Fi router may easily waste this amount of electricity. Let alone just the standby of large TV screens, when talking about wastage. Many people don’t know the power draw of every single device they have – neither do I. (Why? I must probably come back to this topic later). A CO2 calculator, referrring to a database of the Energy Authoricy says that one kWh of electricity consumed in Finland produces 290 grams of CO2. This freezing project of mine, therefore, produces ~22 kg of CO2 = 0.022 tons of CO2.

As we know, small streams form a river, so let’s make a small hypothetical calculation. I heard from radio, that 3 million Finnish people label themselves as berry-pickers (that’s quite a lot!). Let’s assume, that maybe 30% of these people are hard-working berry-harvesters and need extra cold storage, and typically there lives two people in a household. Of course, many berry-pickers probably live with other berry-pickers, but I assume an equal distribution of berry-pickers within the population, results in 500 000 freshly-initiated freezers humming. If my logic is in any sense on a right track, all this would lead to an eleven thousand tons of carbon dioxide (=3000000X0.3X0.5X75 kWhX281g_CO2ekv/kWh)! Could this be right? Could please somebody with experience with CO2 calculations confirm this or correct me if I am wrong?

So an annual berry-storing project of me and my fellow citizen may produce <b>eleven thousand tons of carbon dioxide</b>! When 17 Watts of power sounds small, 11 tons of CO2 no longer does so. Could we change this practice? Could there be less freezers? Notwithstanding that the initial idea of putting a freezer on just for the sake of some cloudberries sounds a bit crazy. Because cloudberries actually contain naturally preservatives, and therefore their freezing is not necessary. My grandmother just kept her berries in their buckets in a cold underground cellar. I could also make delicious and sweet cloudberry jam, seal the glasses, and place them the same cellar. But where is my cellar? I live in Helsinki, in an apartment block, built in the 1960’s, and I believe there must have been some cold common storage rooms somewhere in the building or around. I think it is no longer there. In the olden times, there were no freezers in these apartments, which I can say by a hole in our kitchen wall (which is filled up now, of course, but the remainder is there). That types of holes allowed some cold air from outside indoors to access a cold space/room/box for storing groceries.

Even though berry-picking and eating might easily justify my additional 17 Watts consumption (I will buy less imported fruit and berries, for example. I will also use the 17 Watts for storing wild mushroom which reduces other proteins’ (like meat) consumption, good for health etc.), I am still asking: where is the cellar? Could there be cellars in cities?
